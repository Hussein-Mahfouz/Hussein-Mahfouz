### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a PhD student at the Institute for Transport Studies in Leeds
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in transport modelling and working on projects related to sustainable transport. Specific interests include:
    -  Agent-based simulations of transport networks
    -  Optimization problems for bus networks
    -  Bicycle Networks 
    -  Network science applications to transport resilience
    -  Reproducible research
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
    -  R and open source software!
    -  Open source packages and tools for transport analysis
